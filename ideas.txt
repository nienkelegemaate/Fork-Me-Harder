MAIN TOPIC: Gender Representation (Bias / Inequality) on Wikipedia

Preamble: ..., ... . Yet, with ... responsibility to represent this data ... . In this paper, we aim to quantify
          differences in the representation of males and females on Wikipedia.

MAIN SOURCES (Feel free to add, but I feel that these capture the our primary analysis and main theoretical arguments fairly well):
    1. Unsupervised Discovery of Biographical Structure from Text (Bamman & Smith, 2014)

DATASETS:
    META-DATA PROPERTIES, LANGUAGE PROPERTIES:
    1. The DBPedia 2021 dataset
    2. The Wikipedia English Dump of October 2014.4
    3. Inferred gender for Wikipedia biographies by Bamman and
    Smith [7].5

DATA PRE-PROCESSING:
    1. Exclude elements for which domain includes 'fictional character'
    2. Filter elements for which "date of birth" is known? - This will already reduce element number quite a lot and
       ensure that we are dealing with actual people.
    3. Merge lists from People (A-Z; See Scratch.py)
